# create a virtual environment
python -m venv virtual
source virtual/bin/activate

# to deactivate
source virtual/bin/deactivate

# Now we can do pip install, etc. within the virtual environment
# It will be important to capture what is installed here, but the
# virtual environment is not directly portable and won't be included
# in the git repository
